# my scripts repo

### **I cannot help with any scripts that are obfuscated!!**

all credit goes to the original creator of the scripts

most of the scripts here are open-sourced on purpose, mainly because of the reason above and also because i feel like uploading obfuscated code onto github is bad practice and defeats the whole purpose of the site

if you've got any additions / recommendations feel free to make a pull request or issue according to what it is

i will be making this repository SPM (Synapse Package Manager) compatible when it gets released

other scripts i thought of including but then they also have a github:

* [Infinite yield](https://github.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield)
* [CMD-X](https://github.com/CMD-X/CMD-X)

for [vscode.lua](autoexec/vscode.lua) to work you will need to install Synapse Execute for vscode (if you use that)

open command menu (`ctrl + p`)
then type
`ext install fyz.synapse-ws-serv`

* [simplespy](scripts/simplespy.lua): cool remote spy, [repo](https://github.com/exxtremestuffs/SimpleSpySource)
* [alora](scripts/alora.lua): Open source counter blox movement/legit script their [discord](https://discord.gg/R5aNJNmUMn), [github](https://github.com/sj0rs1/alora)
* [robloxlspsynx](scripts/robloxlspsynx.lua): In-Game autocomplete support for the Roblox LSP VSCode plugin. **May cause stutters.**

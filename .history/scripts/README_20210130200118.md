# scripts
all credit goes to the original creator of the scripts!!!!!!!!!!!

list of scripts i fix sometimes and just generally do stuff with

other scripts i tought of including but then they also have a github:

* [Infinite yield](https://github.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield)
* [CMD-X](https://github.com/CMD-X/CMD-X)

for vscode.lua to work you will need to install Synapse Execute for vscode (if you use that)

open command menu (ctrl + p)
then type
`ext install fyz.synapse-ws-serv`
